# bank_marketing_campaign
This project analyzes a bank's marketing campaign data to understand customer behavior and predict term deposit subscription likelihood. 
The dataset contains information about customers' demographics, financial status, and campaign interactions. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and predictive modeling using a Random Forest Classifier.

Project Goals:

Analyze customer demographics and financial characteristics to identify patterns in deposit subscriptions.
Segment customers based on their financial behavior and engagement with the campaign.
Build a predictive model to identify customers with a high probability of subscribing to a term deposit.
Provide actionable insights to optimize future marketing campaigns and improve customer targeting.
Methodology:

Data Loading and Cleaning:

Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Handle missing values and clean the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of key variables.
Visualize relationships between customer attributes and deposit subscriptions.
Identify potential predictors of deposit subscription.
Customer Segmentation:

Apply clustering techniques to group customers with similar financial and engagement profiles.
Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.
Predictive Modeling:

Prepare the data for modeling by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict deposit subscription.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
Key Findings:

The dataset contains 11,162 customer records with 17 variables.
Key features influencing deposit subscription include customer duration, balance, age, and the month of contact.
The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 84% in predicting deposit subscriptions.
Insights:

The project provides insights into customer segments that are more likely to subscribe to term deposits.
The predictive model can be used to target potential customers and improve campaign efficiency.
The analysis highlights the importance of factors such as customer engagement and financial stability in deposit subscriptions.
Recommendations:

Focus marketing efforts on customer segments with high predicted probabilities of deposit subscription.
Tailor marketing messages and offers based on customer demographics and financial profiles.
Optimize campaign timing and contact methods to improve customer engagement.
Future Work:

Explore additional predictive modeling techniques to improve accuracy.
Develop a customer relationship management (CRM) strategy based on the segmentation analysis.
Analyze the cost-effectiveness of different marketing channels.
